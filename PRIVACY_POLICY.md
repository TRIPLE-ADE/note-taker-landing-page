# Privacy Policy for Private AI Note

**Last Updated: December 31, 2025**

## Introduction

Private AI Note ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application ("App").

**Important: Our app is designed to be completely offline-first. No user-generated content (notes, audio recordings, or images) is ever transmitted to our servers or any external services.**

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device
- **Notes and Content**: All text notes, audio recordings, images, and AI-generated content you create
- **App Settings**: Your theme preferences and other app configuration
- **AI Models**: Downloaded AI models (LLaMA and Whisper) for offline processing

This data remains entirely on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third parties.

### Information We Collect for App Improvement (Anonymous)
We use Sentry (a third-party error monitoring service) to help us identify and fix crashes and performance issues:

- **Crash Reports**: Anonymous error logs when the app crashes
- **Device Information**: Operating system version, device model, and app version (no personal identifiers)
- **Performance Data**: How the app performs on different devices
- **Session Recordings**: Anonymous recordings of user interactions (collected for 10% of sessions and 100% of error sessions to help fix bugs)

**No personal data, IP addresses, or identifiable information is collected by Sentry.**

## How We Use Information

### Local Data (Stored on Your Device)
- To provide the core functionality of the app (creating, storing, and managing notes)
- To enable AI-powered features like transcription and chat
- To maintain your app preferences and settings

### Anonymous Diagnostic Data (via Sentry)
- To identify and fix app crashes and bugs
- To improve app performance and stability
- To understand how the app works across different devices

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

**We do not share, sell, or transmit your personal data or user-generated content to any third parties.**

The only external service we use is Sentry for crash reporting, and they receive only anonymous diagnostic data as described above.

## Data Security

- All your notes, audio recordings, and images stay on your device
- We do not have access to your data
- AI processing happens locally on your device
- Data is stored using secure local storage (SQLite database)

## Your Rights and Choices

Since your data never leaves your device, you have full control:

- **Delete Data**: You can delete all notes, audio recordings, and AI models through the app settings
- **Export Data**: You can export your notes as JSON files
- **Disable Diagnostics**: The app will continue to work normally even if diagnostic reporting encounters issues

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect personal information from children. Since the app works entirely offline and requires no account creation, it is suitable for users of all ages. However, we recommend parental supervision for users under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. We will notify users of any material changes through the app or app store updates.

## Contact Us

Since our app operates completely offline, we don't maintain a user database or email support system. For privacy-related questions or concerns:

- Contact us through the app store (Google Play Store or Apple App Store) reviews or support
- Submit issues or questions on our GitHub repository (if available)

## Compliance

This privacy policy is designed to comply with:
- Google Play Data Safety requirements
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Other applicable privacy laws

**Private AI Note** is developed as an offline-first application. Your privacy and data security are our highest priorities.
